## üß† How It Works

1. `content.js` is injected into WhatsApp Web on load  
2. It watches the DOM for new incoming messages  
3. If a message matches any of your defined keywords, it triggers the reply logic  
4. SnapReply simulates typing the response into the chat and sends it  

‚úÖ All replies are seamless, fast, and simulate real user interaction.
